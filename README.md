## Who am I?

I'm Lorenzo👋, or, if you prefer, I usually go by the online name `Oenarion`.

### A few things about me:
  - 🖥️ Passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, with a personal love for **Computer Vision**.
  - 🧩 I see **problem-solving** as a creative process – and code as my favorite tool.
  - 🎮 Often found tinkering with **pygame**, time given I’ll eventually learn Unity or Godot—right after I finish the 573 projects I have open.
  - 💼 Currently working as a **full-time AI Engineer**, because food doesn’t buy itself (sadly).

### 🎯 Beyond Coding
When I’m not stuck debugging something that should totally work but doesn’t, you’ll probably find me:
  - 🎮 **Playing videogames** (when I find the time… which is increasingly rare).
  - 🥊 **Kickboxing** (because maybe my brain works better after a few hits).
  - 📚 **Reading manga or books** (words are easier to debug than code).
  - 🌀 **Staring into the void**, contemplating life, AI, and whether I should finally clean my workspace.
