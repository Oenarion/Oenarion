## 👋 Hey there, I'm Lorenzo!

### 🧠 Who am I?

...I'm Lorenzo, didn't you read the first line of the page? Or, if you prefer, call me `Oenarion`-I won’t stop you.

  - 🖥️ Passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, with a special love for **Computer Vision**.
  - 🧩 A firm believer that **problem-solving** is an art, and coding is the ultimate paintbrush! Finding new algorithms and optimized solutions keeps me up at night (literally).
  - 🎮 Often found tinkering with **pygame** (because Python is my comfort zone), but eventually I’ll learn Unity or Godot—right after I finish the 573 projects I have open.
  - 💼 Currently working as a **full-time AI Engineer**, because food doesn’t buy itself (sadly).

### 🔧 Work in Progress... I guess?
I have an impressive collection of half-finished projects—somewhere between "I'll get back to it next week" and "What was I even trying to do here?".
But hey, progress is progress... right? 🚀

### 🎯 Beyond Coding
When I’m not stuck debugging something that should totally work but doesn’t, you’ll probably find me:
  - 🎮 **Playing videogames** (when I find the time… which is increasingly rare, sadly)
  - 🥊 **Kickboxing** (because why not mix logic with physical combat?)
  - 📚 **Reading manga or books** (words are easier to debug than code).
  - 🌀 **Staring into the void**, contemplating life, AI, and whether I should finally clean my workspace.
